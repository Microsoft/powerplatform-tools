# Center of Excellence Starter Kit
The Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit is a set of templates that are designed to help develop a strategy for adopting, maintaining and supporting the Power Platform, with a focus on Power Apps and Power Automate. The kit includes multiple Power Apps and Power BI analytics reports to view and interact with the data collected.  The kit also provides several assets that provide templates and suggested patterns and practices for implementing CoE efforts. The assets part of the CoE Starter Kit should be seen as a template from which you inherit your individual solution or can serve as inspiration for implementing your own apps and flows.

## Setup Instructions and Documentation

### Latest Update
Date | Notes
---|---
2021.04.08 | **Core Components**: We are now capturing Capacity and Add-On information for Environments. Information is captured in the Admin \| Sync Template v3 flow, and written to new Environment Capacity and Environment Add-On tables that have a 1:n relationship with Environment. We also added an Environment Business Area table that allows a customer to add a cost code, business area, and environment owner to an Environment - an admin would have to manually add this information in the model driven app. Admins can also set approved capacity and receive alerts when environments are over or close to their approved capacity. No enforcement takes place here, of course, it's just a number to compare to. We have added the Admin \| Welcome Email and App Catalog, previously in Nurture, to Core in an effort to uncouple Nurture from Core and allow it to be installed stand-alone. With the current release, there's still a dependency on the CoE settings table in Core but with the next release we will move those settings to Environment Variables. The Power BI Report has been changed from Import to DirectQuery mode and is using the new Dataverse connector to get the data now. This means you will have to have access to the underlying data to view the report and you will no longer need to set a schedule refresh on the dataset. We decomissioned the Audit Log flows that used basic authentication.<br>**Core Components for Teams**: The CoE Starter Kit can now be installed in Dataverse for Teams environments, docs will be updated with setup instructions - for Core, a forked solution called Core for Teams will have to be used. <br>**Governance Components**: This solution can be installed in both Production and Dataverse for Teams environment (the same solution). The Developer Compliance Center has been updated with a new responsive layout and teams look. We have added a new Environment variable to allow customers to exclude the Default environment from the Admin \| Compliance detail request flow, based on customer feedback. <br>**Nurture Components**: This solution can be installed in both Production and Dataverse for Teams environment (the same solution). All apps have been updated with a new responsive layout and teams look. We have developed a new tool called Maker Assessment which has been added to the Nurture solution. This app will take a maker through a set of questions, and they will receive governance and license considerations to keep in mind prior to building the solution. The goal is for a maker to make the best decision possible based on what their internal policies and support is (e.g. they won't start using AI Builder with a trial if their company is not ready to support this yet). We provide a starter set of questions that customers can update and change with an admin app.
2021.03.03 | **Core Components**: Sync Flow (Apps) has been optimized into seperate loops. PowerApps App and Flow tables have new Environment ID fields, and Sync Flow (Apps) and Sync Flow (Flow) flows store the ID to avoid delegation issues in the DLP Editor. DLP Editor v2 has been updated to avoid delegation. **Governance and Nurture components**: canvas apps have been updated with responsive layouts. **Audit Log components** JSON schema has been updated based on customer issues.
2021.02.03 | ALM Accelerator for Makers (GitHub): Fixed an issue with provisioning environments that was caused by an update to the Power Platform Admin connector #739.

2021.02.01 | Core Components: New Exclude from Archive flag on PowerApps App and Flow tables. DLP Editor added.

The CoE Starter Kit consists of three solutions;

### Center of Excellence – Core Components 
These components provide the core to get started with setting up a CoE – they sync all your resources into entities and build admin apps on top of that to help you get more visibility of what apps, flows and makers are in your environment. Additionally, apps like the DLP Editor and Set New App Owner help with daily admin tasks.
The Core Components solution only contains assets relevant to admins. No assets need to be shared with other makers or end users.
**Requirements:**  Users(s) will require a Per User license, as well as Global or Power Platform Service Admin permissions

### Center of Excellence – Governance Components
Once you are familiar with your environments and resources, you will start thinking about audit and compliance processes for your apps. You will also want to gather additional information about your apps from your makers, and to audit specific connectors or app usage - apps like the Developer Compliance Center and flows to identify connector usage part of this solution will help with that.
The Audit Components solution contains assets relevant to admins and existing makers. 
The Audit Components provides a layer on top of the Core Components, it is required to install the Core Components prior to using the Audit Components. 
**License Requirements:**  Makers participating in the audit and compliance workflows will need a Per App or Per User License.

### Center of Excellence – Nurture Components
An essential part of establishing a CoE is nurturing your makers and internal community. You will want to share best practices and templates and onboard new makers – the assets part of this solution, like the Welcome Email and Template Catalog can help develop a strategy for this motion.
The Nurture Components solution contains assets relevant to everyone in the organisation. 
The Nurture Components provides a layer on top of the Core Components, it is required to install the Core Components prior to using the Nurture Components.
**License Requirements:**  Anyone in CoE community will need a Per App or Per User License.

### Center of Excellence – Theming Components

A frequent ask when creating canvas apps apps is theming and specifically the ability to create apps that match the organization brand.  The assets in this solution will help you create, manage and share themes.
The Theming Components solution contains assets that are relevant to makers and designers. 

We recommend getting started and familiar with the **Center of Excellence – Core Components** before adding the Audit and Nurture components or building your own assets on top of the Core Components entities.
