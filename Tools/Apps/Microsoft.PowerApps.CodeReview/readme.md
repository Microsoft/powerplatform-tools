## App Checker Results

The app checker screen shows the results from the last app checker result run for the app. These results are available in the Power Apps studio as your build your app. They are included in this tool for convenience.

## App Overview

The app overview section allows us to quickly check if certain important app setting flags are on. The flags have an impact on performance. The screen info section gives us a quick count of the number of controls used for each screen to ensure that it is below the recommended max of 300 control per screen. The media files sections list all medias embedded with the app as well as their size. Finally, the network trace section helps identify slow network requests within the app.
